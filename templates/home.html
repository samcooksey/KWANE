    <h2>Welcome Operatives! The two of you have been selected to upload some very important information from a very secret location... Atlantis!</br></br> One of you will be transported into the maze using their smart phone (We will refer to you as the Operative). The other will assist them from the outside using this computer (You will be the Oracle).</br></br> There are a few things you both need to know before you start. We have some information about the temple you are about to explore, but not all of it. Please consult this diagram:</h2>

    <h1>Please review this information carefully!</h1>
    <h2>As you can see, the temple is split into 5 rooms.</br></br> The Operative will start in the center room. This is also your extraction point. The Operative needs to visit each of the other 4 rooms and activate an Information Stone before we can safely extract them. This is where things get tricky.</br></br> We know that there are 4 rooms, and we know that they are connected with many labyrinthine passages, but we never know which rooms are in which location. Luckily, the Oracle will have the information necessary to figure this out.</br></br> For each of the 4 quarters of the temple, the Oracle will need to communicate with the Operative in order to ascertain which quarter of the temple they are currently exploring. Once they figure this out, the Oracle can then guide the Operative to that quarter's room.</br></br> Once in the room, the Operative will be faced with one of four challenges. We know much about these challenges, but once again, the temple changes its layout every time we visit. The Oracle just needs to follow along with the relevant prompts for each challenge.</br></br> As the Oracle figures out pieces of information, they will be expected to trace a path along a chart of possible passcodes. Once the passcode is discovered for each of the four rooms, the Oracle should enter it into the appropriate input field and submit it. Only after the passcode has been successfully submitted, can the Operative activate the Information Stone.</br></br> To do this, they must simply walk all the way up to it and touch it.</br></br> After all 4 information stones are activated, the Operative should make their way back to the center of the temple and activate the Information Stone inside of the extraction beam.</br></br> You will be compensated upon review of the information received from the temple. Thank you for your service, and good luck!</h2>
